The problem MV(MintVault) solves

Meta-Transactions (EIP-2771): By implementing meta-transactions, users can execute transactions without needing to hold native tokens for gas fees. Instead, the gas cost is abstracted and covered by the system.
Gasless Transactions: Utilizing protocols like EIP-4337 for Account Abstraction, the project ensures users experience seamless, fee-free transactions without worrying about network complexities.
Wallet-Free Interaction: The Okto Wallet integration allows users to skip wallet setup and direct token management, reducing friction and enhancing user accessibility.
Simplified Onramp: Users can buy crypto with fiat, and the system ensures instant delivery of USDT directly into their Okto Wallet with minimal or no interaction.
